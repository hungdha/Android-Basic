I can explain what I mean by the last point with an example: suppose your assignment is to implement a data
export facility in three days. You’d probably figure on providing a basic filtering capability to select the data, a simple
way of previewing the output, and maybe a choice of comma-separated-value (CSV) or tab-delimited output formats.
Now suppose you have two months to do the export module. You’d expect to develop a much more elaborate query
facility, a much wider choice of outputs, probably including XML (Extensible Markup Language), SQL (Structured
Query Language), and maybe even RTF (Rich Text Format), and a way to store the export specification as a preset for
later recall.
